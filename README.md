# General Onboarding - Reading

There are a lot of things that you can read that will help set context for everything going on at Flatiron School. This will take a couple of hours - you can space it out over the course of your first week.

### External-facing reading

- Our **[blog](http://blog.flatironschool.com/)** is updated pretty frequently, with a mixture of news/partnership announcements, student/alumni posts, profiles, and code history posts. 

- Follow Flatiron School on **social media**! We are on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FlatironSchool), Twitter ([@FlatironSchool](https://twitter.com/FlatironSchool)), Instagram ([@flatironschool](https://instagram.com/flatironschool/)), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-flatiron-school), and Snapchat (username: flatironschool).

- In 2014, we produced an end-of-year **[Annual Report](http://far.flatironschool.com/)** and **[Jobs Report](http://flatironschool.com/jobs-report-2014-ty)**. Read both.

- Read about our **course offerings.** Our website has information about our [adult education offerings](http://flatironschool.com/courses) and our [Summer 2015 Pre-College Academy Brochure](https://flatironschool.box.com/s/2lnyga72d7rvhq654poayt8bu4g8rm9x) has information about our pre-college offerings.

- Check out our **[careers page](http://flatironschool.com/careers)** to see what roles we are hiring for; talk to Mike Linshi if you have any questions about the hiring plan, or if you have any referrals (we have an employee referral bonus)!

### Internal reading

- Check your **Gmail inbox** and **Google Calendar**. You already have a lot of emails and calendar invites. You can take a look at previous team@ email communication that isn't in your inbox [here](https://groups.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/forum/#!forum/team).

- Every week, we produce a **Flatiron Weekly Internal Newsletter (FWIN).** The FWIN is a weekly email that goes out to the whole company with updates on what's been going on. You should read the most recent ~1-2 months of FWINs on the [wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewrecentblogposts.action?key=OP) to get a better sense of what's been going on. Going forward, you can contribute to the FWIN by emailing your updates to Adam Enbar before Sunday.

- Our **[wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/dashboard.action)** as a whole has a wealth of information. In particular, you should check out the [Employee Resources space](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Employee+Resources+Home), the most recent [team meeting presentation](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/MEM/Values), our updated [Values](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/MEM/Values), our [Code of Conduct](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/MEM/Code+of+Conduct), and [Small Improvements (staff feedback process)](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/Staff+Feedback+Processes+-+Small+Improvements).

- When talking about Flatiron School, please refer to our **[Voice and Tone Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19oCZYX8ikCd7rMF2OvisCPeuB0Rwy39SfwyT8b1R2Vw/edit#heading=h.oad2jv7jjs07)**. Note: We are in the process of updating these.
